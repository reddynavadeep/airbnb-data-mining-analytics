# Airbnb Data Mining and Analysis

## Business Understanding
Airbnb dataset is a humongous amount of information available on properties in the market, for rental purposes. The data consists of information on hosts, locality, amenities and many more aspects of the property. Study and analysis of the data provides insights, performance and future predictions about the properties in the market. Adopting machine learning algorithms like Boosting can drive business decisions to increase revenue and reach in the airbnb market.

By adopting Boosting technique, we predict whether an airbnb property will bag a 100% perfect rating score or not. In addition to supporting the airbnb platform to make significant value- increasing decisions, the analysis covers a wide range of clients such as property owners, real estate management firms and the hospitality industry to improvise and expand their business and services. The study will support the legal authorities to understand trends in the rental sector of the real-estate market.
The report built out of data mining and predictive analytics can be a base for upcoming new entrants in the business such as airbnb. The firm can start building their research and expand analysis on the report in order to cater the business requirements of their unique objective.

Tourism is one of the major revenue generating industries. Laying out a detailed analysis on the given airbnb housing will set to the rise of new businesses in the locality and increase popularity over due course of time. For instance, locations which see high inflow of renters can open up a window for restaurant chains set up in the locality.
